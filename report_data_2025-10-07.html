Bayer opposed these amendments, asserting that they lacked a real prospect of success and would significantly increase costs and complexity of the inquiry. The Deputy Judge analyzed principles relating to strike out and summary judgment, the relevance of Bayer’s conduct to damages assessment, and the connection between the alleged misconduct and the counterfactual scenario used for damages calculation. Ultimately, the Judge concluded that Sandoz’s proposed amendments lacked prospects of success because their relevance to damages assessment was insufficient, and permitting them would lead to unwarranted costs and resource expenditure.</p><p>URL: <a href ='https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/pat/2025/2533'>https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/pat/2025/2533</a></p><hr></div><div><h4>[2025] UKFTT 1192 (GRC) - Devtech Security Limited v The Pensions Regulator</h4><p>Ruled in favour of <b>Plaintiff</b></p><p>The hearing focused on whether the Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear an appeal by the Appellant against a £400 Fixed Penalty Notice for failing to submit a Declaration of Compliance by the deadline. The Appellant argued that the penalty arose due to a misunderstanding regarding eligibility for auto-enrolment and procedural delays, emphasizing good faith and minimal staff. The Respondent contended that the Tribunal lacked jurisdiction and sought to strike out the reference, citing procedural rules and time limits for review requests. The case involved procedural disputes, timing of responses, and jurisdictional issues, referencing relevant case law to determine if the Tribunal can hear the appeal.</p><p>URL: <a href ='https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukftt/grc/2025/1192'>https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukftt/grc/2025/1192</a></p><hr></div><div><h4>[2025] EWCA Civ 1244 - Ashokkumar Dhandapani, R (on the application of) v Secretary of State for the Home Department</h4><p>Ruled in favour of <b>Plaintiff</b></p><p>The hearing concerns the validity of a Home Office decision to cancel or curtail leave under UK immigration law, focusing on the procedures for serving notices to individuals via email or other methods. It examines the legal requirements for giving notice, the presumption of receipt, and the standards for judicial review applications challenging such decisions, especially whether the person affected adequately received or became aware of the notice, in accordance with statutory and case law interpretations.</p><p>URL: <a href ='https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2025/1244'>https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2025/1244</a></p><hr></div><div><h4>[2025] EWHC 2539 (Comm) - K1 (a company incorporated in Kuwait) & Ors v B</h4><p>Ruled in favour of <b>Plaintiff</b></p><p>This hearing concerns the enforcement and challenge of an LCIA arbitration award totaling US$3.2 million awarded against the Claimants in favor of the Defendant. The dispute stems from contractual obligations under a letter of engagement signed by the Defendant, with the Claimants challenging the tribunal's jurisdiction under section 67 of the Arbitration Act 1996, arguing they were not bound by the arbitration agreement. Additionally, the Claimants sought permission to amend their claim under section 68(2)(g) for alleged serious irregularity and to extend time limits under section 70(3). The court is reviewing whether the challenge is valid and whether proceedings are within allowable deadlines.</p><p>URL: <a href ='https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/comm/2025/2539'>https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/comm/2025/2539</a></p><hr></div><div><h4>[2025] EWCA Civ 1262 - Colin Robertson v Google LLC</h4><p>Ruled in favour of <b>Plaintiff</b></p><p>The hearing concerned whether a party, Mr Robertson, successfully obtained relief from sanctions for failing to effect valid service of a claim form on Google within six months, focusing on the applicable procedural rule (r.7.6(3)) versus the broader relief from sanctions rule (r.3.9). The judge granted relief under r.3.9 and also made a costs order. Google appealed this decision, and Mr Robertson cross-appealed the costs order, arguing that some costs related to a separate jurisdiction challenge should not have been included, and claimed no causal link between that challenge and the relief proceedings.</p><p>URL: <a href ='https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2025/1262'>https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2025/1262</a></p><hr></div><div><h4>[2025] EWHC 2541 (Admin) - EAD, R (on the application of) v Director of Public Prosecutions</h4><p>Ruled in favour of <b>Defendant</b></p><p>The case involved a judicial review of the CPS's decision not to charge a suspect, with the court examining whether the decision followed proper guidance, assessed the evidence correctly, and was lawful under Article 3. The judge concluded that the CPS's decision was thoroughly reasoned, lawful, and reasonable, ultimately dismissing grounds questioning the evidential sufficiency and charging rationale.</p><p>URL: <a href ='https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/admin/2025/2541'>https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/admin/2025/2541</a></p><hr></div><div><h4>[2025] UKFTT 1186 (GRC) - David Wayne Rodgers v The Information Commissioner</h4><p>Ruled in favour of <b>Defendant</b></p><p>The case revolves around an FOIA request made by the Appellant to Bridgend County Borough Council seeking information about council tax discounts and related personal data of an individual. The Council refused disclosure, citing exemptions under Section 40(5) for personal data, and the Information Commissioner upheld this decision, concluding that confirming or denying the existence of such information would violate data protection laws. The Appellant argued significant interests in transparency related to a probate case, but the ICO found that the disclosure would breach personal privacy rights and that less intrusive means exist to address his concerns.</p><p>URL: <a href ='https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukftt/grc/2025/1186'>https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukftt/grc/2025/1186</a></p><hr></div><div><h4>[2025] EWHC 2510 (Admin) - Tilat Khan, R (on the application of) v Leicester Magistrates’ Court</h4><p>Ruled in favour of <b>Plaintiff</b></p><p>This hearing concerns a judicial review of a costs order made by magistrates in a council tax dispute. The Claimant contested the fairness of the opportunity to make submissions regarding the costs awarded (£13,500). The case examines whether the Claimant was given a proper chance to be heard before the costs order was made, raising issues of natural justice and human rights. The court considered witness statements and whether the process was lawful, with the overarching issue being the fairness of the proceedings and whether the Claimant had an adequate opportunity to present their case.</p><p>URL: <a href ='https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/admin/2025/2510'>https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/admin/2025/2510</a></p><hr></div><div><h4>[2025] EAT 142 - Partnership of East London Co-Operatives Ltd v Joanne MacLean</h4><p>Ruled in favour of <b>Defendant</b></p><p>The hearing was about the employment status of a clinical services provider, specifically whether they were an employee, worker, or self-employed individual. The tribunal examined contractual arrangements, the provision of services through a limited company, the payment structure, and the employment relationship. Key issues included whether the respondent provided services directly or via a limited company, the acceptance of a substitute worker, and payment responsibilities. The tribunal dismissed grounds questioning the nature of the contractual relationship, confirming that the contract was with the limited company and not the individual directly, affecting employment rights and liabilities.</p><p>URL: <a href ='https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/eat/2025/142'>https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/eat/2025/142</a></p><hr></div><p>From, Objection Handling</p>
