It examines the interpretation of 'giving notice' under the Immigration Act 1971, the Immigration (Leave to Enter and Remain) Order 2000, and related regulations, including the impact of the case R (Alam) and R (Rana) v SSHD. The discussion analyzes what constitutes proper service and receipt of notices, the burden of proof regarding non-receipt, and the authorities' guidance on serving cancellation and curtailment decisions. The key issue is whether notices sent electronically are deemed received upon dispatch, and the legal implications for cases where recipients do not open or actively acknowledge receipt. The ruling of whether the defendant's notice was valid and properly served is central.</p><p>URL: <a href ='https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2025/1244'>https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2025/1244</a></p><hr></div><div><h4>[2025] EWHC 2539 (Comm) - K1 (a company incorporated in Kuwait) & Ors v B</h4><p>Ruled in favour of <b>Defendant</b></p><p>The hearing concerned an LCIA arbitration award of US$3.2 million against Claimants in favor of the Defendant, based on a letter of engagement signed in 2018. The Claimants challenged the tribunal's jurisdiction under section 67 of the Arbitration Act 1996, arguing they were not bound by the agreement or lacked capacity under Kuwaiti law. They sought permission to amend their claim under section 68(2)(g) on the grounds of alleged serious irregularity and requested extensions related to time limits under section 70(3). The core issue was the validity of the arbitration agreement and jurisdiction, with related procedural applications and challenges.</p><p>URL: <a href ='https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/comm/2025/2539'>https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/comm/2025/2539</a></p><hr></div><div><h4>[2025] EWCA Civ 1262 - Colin Robertson v Google LLC</h4><p>Ruled in favour of <b>Plaintiff</b></p><p>The hearing concerned whether Mr Robertson's failure to serve his claim form on Google in the USA within 6 months justified relief under the CPR rules. The judge examined if the relevant rule was r.7.6(3) enabling extension of time, which Mr Robertson could not satisfy, or if relief was available under broader sanctions rules (r.3.9). The judge ultimately granted relief under r.3.9. Additionally, there was a cross-appeal regarding costs; Mr Robertson argued that the costs related to separate jurisdiction challenges by Google should not have been included in the costs order. The case centered on procedural compliance, the correct application of rules, and associated costs.</p><p>URL: <a href ='https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2025/1262'>https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2025/1262</a></p><hr></div><div><h4>[2025] UKFTT 1186 (GRC) - David Wayne Rodgers v The Information Commissioner</h4><p>Ruled in favour of <b>Defendant</b></p><p>The case involves a request under the FOIA by the Appellant to Bridgend County Borough Council for information about a specific individual's council tax discounts and medical reasons, which the Council refused citing data protection laws. The Appellant challenged this refusal, asserting a conflict of interest and referencing ongoing legal cases. The Information Commissioner reviewed the case, upheld the Council's refusal to confirm or deny the existence of the information, and concluded that disclosing such details would breach personal data rights. The Appellant argued his legal rights and a broader public interest, but these were found insufficient to override individual privacy. The case primarily concerns the balance between public interest in transparency and personal data protection.</p><p>URL: <a href ='https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukftt/grc/2025/1186'>https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukftt/grc/2025/1186</a></p><hr></div><div><h4>[2025] EWHC 2510 (Admin) - Tilat Khan, R (on the application of) v Leicester Magistrates’ Court</h4><p>Ruled in favour of <b>Plaintiff</b></p><p>This case concerns a judicial review of a decision by magistrates to impose costs of £13,500 on a Claimant for contesting a liability notice for council tax. The core issue is whether the Claimant was afforded a fair opportunity to make representations regarding the costs, in light of alleged breaches of natural justice and human rights, following the magistrates' decision without prior notice or opportunity for the Claimant's legal representation to oppose the costs. The hearing involved examination of whether procedural fairness was observed, and the court considered submissions on costs, including detailed legal arguments about reasonableness and the appropriate amount.</p><p>URL: <a href ='https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/admin/2025/2510'>https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/admin/2025/2510</a></p><hr></div><p>From, Objection Handling</p>
